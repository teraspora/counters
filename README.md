# Counters:  Demonstration of outputting numbers in a shader.

This shader shows how to output numbers to the screen, using 5x5 bitmaps to make old-style calculator digits.
For demonstration's sake, it displays four panes, showing 
* The running time in seconds
* The square of this number
* The largest prime number less than it
* A repeating display of the powers of 2 with fewer than ten digits

The code for the four panes is from my "Polypane" shader, to be found at
https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4tVcDK and
https://github.com/teraspora/polypane.

## Execution

Go to https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MtKyDK.
Play with it by looking inside the `case` blocks and changing the functions used to define `num`.

## To do

Add more bitmaps for letters, punctuation and custom icons.
Note, will have to target them with ASCII codes for example, as GLSL has no strings.
